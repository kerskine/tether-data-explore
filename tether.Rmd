## Summary

This is the last part to write

## Background



## Data Exploration

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Setup, , cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(igraph)

```

## Transaction Flow



```{r }

```

I'd also like to thank Roger Peng, Brian Caffo, Jeff Leek, Johns Hopkins, and Coursera for giving me the working knowledge to attempt this project.
